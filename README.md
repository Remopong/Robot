Here, I'm creating a wireless robot based on MPU6050, NRF24L01 and Servo 9g (motor might change later). Every part of our body will have a mpu6050 to get the tilt of it. Transmitting to the robot through NRF24L01 modules, so the robot will move as you are. The gyroscope need to be calibrate with the Offsets. And the transmittig modules needs a capacitor between the + and the - around 10 uF, else it won't work.
